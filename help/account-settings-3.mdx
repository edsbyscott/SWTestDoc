| To be, or not to be, that is the question:  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles | and by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,  No more; and by a sleep to say we end  The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks  That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;  To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  Must give us pause—there's the respect | No traveller returns, puzzles the will,  And makes us rather bear those ills we have  Than fly to others that we know not of?  Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,  And thus the native hue of resolution  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,  And enterprises of great pith and moment  With this regard their currents turn awry  And lose the name of action. |
