## What do you need to log in?

- The **Edsby URL** provided by your school or district. Find it on your school or district’s website, or ask your school directly. It will resemble https://your-server.edsby.com, where “your-server” is a name unique to your school or district. The server address will be requested by the Edsby app when you first log in.
- A **username**. Your school or district will assign you a username. This is a unique identifier that could be a staff or student number, an email address, your name, or something else. Every school or district sets up usernames differently, so make sure to ask your school if you don’t know yours.
- A **password**. Ask your school if you’ve already been assigned a password. If you haven’t you will be prompted to create a password the first time you log in.

Access to your Edsby system is controlled by your school or district. If you forgot your login credentials or have been locked out of your account for using an incorrect password, contact your school. Some aggressive access control systems disable accounts after a number of unsuccessful tries. Even if you remember what your correct credentials are, you might still be denied access to Edsby and your other computer systems until your account is reset by a tech resource at your school.
