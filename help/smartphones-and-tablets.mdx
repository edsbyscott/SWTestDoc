However, most people prefer to have an “app” for their mobile device, and Edsby does that as well.

## Edsby iOS App

To install the free Edsby iOS app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, click the icon below that says Available on the App Store.  Once the Edsby app is installed, simply provide it with the address of your Edsby server, which is usually similar to “xyzorg.edsby.com”. Get it from your school if you don’t know it. Then, just provide your Edsby user name and password.
