To download and save a local copy of a report card, view the report card from an Edsby desktop browser login. Use the print to PDF feature available in most mainstream browsers to save the report card to a PDF file on a device. Depending on the report card format, best results may be obtained by toggling off margins and headers and/or selecting portrait vs. landscape orientation.
